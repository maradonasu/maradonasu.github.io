在通往目标的路上,通常都有一堵墙阻挡<br />但请记住,阻挡你的障碍必有其原因<br />这道墙不是为了阻止我们<br />着道墙让我们有机会展现自己有多想达到这目标<br />着道墙是为了阻止那些不够渴望的人<br />它们是为了阻挡那些不够热爱的人而存在的<br />But remember, the brick walls are there for a reason. <br />The brick walls are not there to keep us out. <br />
The brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something. <br />Because the brick walls are there to stop the<br />people who don’t want it badly enough. <br />They’re there to stop the other people.<br />
<br />永不放弃<br />Never give up<br /><br />每个人都有梦想<br />关键不在于如何达成梦想<br />而是无悔的度过人生<br />如果你能好好过人生<br />人生自然会为你寻找答案<br />梦想自然会实现<br />everyone have a dream<br clear="all" />It’s not about how to achieve your dreams.<br />It’s about how to lead your life. <br />
If you lead your life the right way, <br />the karma will take care of itself. <br />The dreams will come to you.<br /><br />
